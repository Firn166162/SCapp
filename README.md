Explanation:
The code defines four functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide, each performing their respective arithmetic operation.
The main function presents a menu to the user to choose an operation.
The user is prompted to enter their choice and input two numbers.
Based on the user's choice, the corresponding function is called, and the result is printed.
The program continues to ask the user if they want to perform another calculation until they choose to exit.
